/**
 * Transforms a route configuration object into a flat array of valid route entries.
 *
 * @param data - An object whose values are route configuration objects.
 * Each value may include properties like `url`, `title`, `path`, etc.
 *
 * @returns An array of route objects where:
 * - Each object has both a `url` and `title` key
 * - Both `url` and `title` must be of type `string`
 *
 * All other entries (objects missing either `url` or `title`, or with incorrect types)
 * are filtered out and excluded from the result.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * {
 *   HOME: { url: '/', title: 'Home' },
 *   LAYOUT: { path: '/' },
 *   LOGIN: { url: '/login' }, // Missing title -> excluded
 * }
 *
 * Output:
 * [

/**
 * TL;DR ðŸ§ 
Routes go in as an object of objects

The function extracts values only (Object.values(...))

Then filters to only those objects that have both url and title as strings

Result is a clean Route[] array ðŸ’¥
